This folder contains the code to replicate Figures 4 and 5 in Scalability of Metropolis-within-Gibbs schemes for high-dimensional Bayesian models (Ascolani, Roberts and Zanella).

It includes the following files:

- "Figure4.R", which contains the code to replicate the simulations in Figure 4.

- "Figure5.R", which contains the code to replicate the simulations in Figure 5.

- "Functions_LogisticRegression.R", which contains the functions to implement a Bayesian logistic regression, with centered priors.

- "Functions_LogisticRegression_nonC.R", which contains the functions to implement a Bayesian logistic regression, with non-centered priors.



See Section 7 for additional details on the simulation settings.
