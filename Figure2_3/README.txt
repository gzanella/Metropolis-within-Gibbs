This folder contains the code to replicate Figures 2 and 3 in Scalability of Metropolis-within-Gibbs schemes for high-dimensional Bayesian models (Ascolani, Roberts and Zanella).

It includes the following files:

- "Main_Figure2.R", which contains the code to replicate the simulations in Figure 2.

- "Main_Figure3.R", which contains the code to replicate the simulations in Figure 3.

- "Functions_HierCovariates.R", which contains the functions to implement a Metropolis-within-Gibbs, with different choices for update of the local parameters (Barker, independent, RwM).



See Section 6.5.1 for additional details on the simulation settings.
